# Crowd Counting Consortium Dataset
This repository is home to a compiled and augmented version of the [Crowd Counting Consortium](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/home)'s data on political protest events in the United States. We use a broad definition of "protest," so the dataset includes protests, rallies, demonstrations, marches, strikes, and similar actions.

- The latest version of the full dataset is stored in csv format in this repository ([here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium/master/ccc_compiled.csv)). The easiest way to access it is to read it directly into your statistical software. If you prefer to download it to a local directory, though, you'll need to:
    1) Open [this page](https://github.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium/blob/master/ccc_compiled.csv) in your browser;
    2) Right-click on the "View raw" linkin the center of the lower tile; and
    3) Choose a name and local destination for the file.

- The [data dictionary](https://github.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium/blob/master/ccc_data_dictionary.md) describes the columns in that file.

- The [coding guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaOf9s72FQnzQA8sbE8h0PwMIZLP6p0EDUV2ya065is/edit?usp=sharing) describe the processes we use to find and encode information about relevant events.

If you use these data, please cite "Crowd Counting Consortium" as the source.

If you have questions about the dataset, please email Jay Ulfelder, Ph.D., at julfelder@hks.harvard.edu.

## General Information
We strive to update this data set weekly, on Wednesdays not later than 4 PM Eastern time, with exceptions around holidays and ends of months. Please note that, while the raw data are updated on a rolling basis, there is some lag between the appearance of a news story or social-media post about an event (or the submission of a form to CCC) and the addition of a complete record to [CCC's Google Sheets](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/view-download-the-data). CCC strives to keep that interval as short as possible, but the project operates on a shoestring budget, so periods of higher protest activity can make for longer delays.

The compiled data set serves as the input to the [Crowd Counting Consortium (CCC) Data Dashboard](https://nonviolentactionlab.shinyapps.io/ccc-data-dashboard/), which interactively maps the events and plots summaries of them. Both the dashboard and the compiled data set are maintained by the [Nonviolent Action Lab](https://carrcenter.hks.harvard.edu/non-violent-social-movements), a research program within the [Carr Center for Human Rights Policy](https://carrcenter.hks.harvard.edu/) at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/). The Crowd Counting Consortium is co-directed by faculty at Harvard University and the University of Connecticut.

The CCC collects these data in the public interest and to further scholarly research. The CCC is not formally affiliated with any other efforts to collect data on demonstrations, though it collaborated with [Count Love](https://countlove.org/) from 2017 until early 2021. Anyone who wishes to conduct research using the data is fully responsible for any necessary contact with their own Institutional Review Boards.

We recognize that [no large-scale data set on political crowds will ever capture all relevant events with 100% accuracy](https://willopines.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/no-more-fountains-of-youthpots-o-gold-conceptualization-and-events-data-part-1/). Even so, we aspire to make this record as complete and error-free as possible. If you see a record that you believe needs correcting, or if you are aware of a relevant event that is not included, please do *not* open an issue here to report it. Instead, please submit a record or correction via the (anonymous) Google Form on the [original CCC website](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/submit-a-record).

If you have suggestions on how to improve this repository or the compiled version of the data it hosts, please submit a ticket via the "Issues" button above (or just click [here](https://github.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium/issues)).
