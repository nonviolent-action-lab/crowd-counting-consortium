# Crowd Counting Consortium Crowd Data
This repository stores a compiled and partially cleaned version of the [Crowd Counting Consortium](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/home)'s data on political crowds in the United States, including marches, protests, demonstrations, strikes, riots, and similar actions. The data are stored in csv format ([here](https://github.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium/blob/master/ccc_compiled.csv)), and the [data dictionary](https://github.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium/blob/master/ccc_data_dictionary.md) briefly describes the columns in that file.

We aim to update this data set weekly, on Fridays not later than 4 PM Eastern time. It serves as the input to the soon-to-launch Crowd Counting Consortium (CCC) Data Dashboard. Both the dashboard and the compiled version of the data set posted here are maintained by the [Nonviolent Action Lab](https://carrcenter.hks.harvard.edu/non-violent-social-movements), a research program within the [Carr Center for Human Rights Policy](https://carrcenter.hks.harvard.edu/) at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/). The Crowd Counting Consortium is co-directed by faculty at Harvard University and the University of Connecticut.

The CCC collects these data in the public interest and to further scholarly research. The CCC is not formally affiliated with any other efforts to collect data on demonstrations, though it collaborates with [Count Love](https://countlove.org/). Anyone who wishes to conduct research using the data is fully responsible for any necessary contact with their own Institutional Review Boards. If you wish to use these data, please include a citation to the “Crowd Counting Consortium.”

We recognize that [no large-scale data set on political crowds will ever capture all relevant events with 100% accuracy](https://willopines.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/no-more-fountains-of-youthpots-o-gold-conceptualization-and-events-data-part-1/). Even so, we aspire to make this record as complete and error-free as possible. If you see a record that you believe needs correcting, or if you are aware of a relevant event that is not included, please do *not* open an issue here to report it. Instead, please submit a record or correction via the CCC website, [here](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/submit-a-record).

If you have suggestions on how to improve this repository or the compiled version of the data it hosts, please open an issue here by clicking on the "Issues" button above (or just [here](https://github.com/nonviolent-action-lab/crowd-counting-consortium/issues)).
